# OCI GenAI Tool Support Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of dynamic tool support checking for OCI GenAI models, addressing issue #41.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. OCIToolTester (`coda/base/providers/oci_tool_tester.py`)
- Dynamic tool testing with caching to avoid repeated API calls
- Stores results in JSON format at `~/.cache/coda/oci_tools/tool_support.json`
- Prepopulates known results based on our testing
- Cache expires after 7 days to handle model updates
- Methods:
  - `get_tool_support()` - Check if a model supports tools
  - `prepopulate_known_results()` - Load known test results
  - `get_cache_stats()` - Get cache statistics
  - `clear_cache()` - Clear cached results

### 2. OCI Provider Updates (`coda/base/providers/oci_genai.py`)
- Integrated tool support checking in `chat()` and `chat_stream()` methods
- Graceful error handling with clear user messages
- Different handling for:
  - Models that don't support tools at all (raises error)
  - Models that support tools only in non-streaming (logs warning)
- Removed Meta model tool call parsing per user direction

### 3. Model Selection UI (`coda/apps/cli/completion_selector.py`)
- Added tool support indicators in model selection:
  - üîß Tools - Full tool support
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Tools - Non-streaming only
  - üö´ Tool Error - Known not to work
  - (no indicator) - Unknown/untested

### 4. CLI Tool Cache Command (`coda/apps/cli/tool_cache_command.py`)
- New `coda tool-cache` command with options:
  - `--stats` - Show cache statistics
  - `--clear` - Clear the cache
  - `--test MODEL` - Test a specific model
  - (default) - List cached results

### 5. Configuration Integration
- Uses centralized config service for cache directory
- Maintains module independence with simple JSON storage
- No cross-module dependencies

## Test Results Summary

Based on our comprehensive testing:

### Models with Tool Support (Non-streaming only):
- cohere.command-latest
- cohere.command-plus-latest  
- cohere.command-r-plus
- cohere.command-r-plus-08-2024
- cohere.command-a-03-2025
- xai.grok-3
- xai.grok-3-fast
- meta.llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8
- meta.llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
- meta.llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct
- meta.llama-3.1-405b-instruct

### Models without Tool Support:
- xai.grok-3-mini (outputs tool syntax but doesn't execute)
- xai.grok-3-mini-fast (outputs tool syntax but doesn't execute)
- meta.llama-3.3-70b-instruct (fine-tuning base model error)
- meta.llama-3.1-70b-instruct (fine-tuning base model error)
- cohere.command-r-08-2024 (fine-tuning base model error)
- cohere.command-r-16k (fine-tuning base model error)
- meta.llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct (404 error)
- meta.llama-3-70b-instruct (404 error)
- cohere.command (400 error)
- cohere.command-light (400 error)

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Module Independence**: Each module maintains its own storage implementation to avoid cross-module dependencies
2. **Centralized Config**: All modules use the centralized config service for directory paths
3. **Dynamic Testing**: Models are tested on-demand with results cached
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messages guide users to working models

## User Experience

When a user tries to use tools with an OCI model:
1. If the model is known not to support tools, they get a clear error message
2. If the model supports tools but not in streaming, they get a warning but can proceed
3. The model selector shows tool support status with visual indicators
4. Users can check tool support using the `coda tool-cache` command

## Future Considerations

1. The cache automatically expires after 7 days to handle model updates
2. New models are tested on first use
3. The prepopulated results can be updated as new models are released
4. GitHub issue #46 documents the tool support problems for OCI team

## Testing

Test scripts created:
- `test_oci_tool_support.py` - Tests the OCIToolTester functionality
- `test_tool_cache_cli.py` - Tests the CLI command
- `test_oci_tools.py` - Comprehensive test of all OCI models (already existed)
