# Test Infrastructure Phases 7 & 8: Web UI and Observability Tests

## Overview

Following the successful completion of Phases 1-6 of the test infrastructure rewrite, we're adding two new phases to properly integrate testing for the Web UI and Observability modules. These modules have been temporarily excluded from the test suite to allow the core infrastructure to stabilize.

## Phase 7: Web UI Test Integration

**Target Date**: After main test infrastructure is stable

### Objectives

1. **Fix Web UI Test Infrastructure**
   - Resolve Selenium WebDriver configuration issues
   - Fix browser test timeouts and flakiness
   - Ensure proper test isolation for Streamlit components

2. **Optimize Web UI Test Execution**
   - Implement headless browser testing for CI
   - Add proper retry mechanisms for flaky UI tests
   - Create visual regression testing framework

3. **Test Organization**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for page workflows
   - E2E tests for critical user journeys

### Deliverables

- Fixed and optimized web UI test suite
- Dedicated CI workflow for web tests
- Documentation for running web tests locally
- Visual regression test baseline

## Phase 8: Observability Test Integration

**Target Date**: After Phase 7 completion

### Objectives

1. **Fix Observability Test Issues**
   - Resolve memory calculation problems in collections tests
   - Fix thread safety test race conditions
   - Ensure proper test isolation for metrics/tracing

2. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Add missing unit tests for observability components
   - Create integration tests for full telemetry pipeline
   - Add performance benchmarks for overhead measurement

3. **Test Organization**
   - Unit tests for each observability component
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Load tests for scalability validation

### Deliverables

- Fixed and comprehensive observability test suite
- Performance benchmark suite
- CI workflow with observability-specific requirements
- Documentation for debugging observability issues

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 7 Steps

1. **Week 1**: Audit and fix existing web UI tests
2. **Week 2**: Implement headless browser testing
3. **Week 3**: Add visual regression testing
4. **Week 4**: Optimize CI execution and documentation

### Phase 8 Steps

1. **Week 1**: Fix memory and threading issues in tests
2. **Week 2**: Expand unit test coverage
3. **Week 3**: Implement integration test suite
4. **Week 4**: Add performance benchmarks and CI optimization

## Success Criteria

### Phase 7
- All web UI tests passing consistently
- Test execution time < 5 minutes
- Zero flaky tests in CI
- Visual regression tests catching UI changes

### Phase 8
- All observability tests passing
- 90%+ code coverage for observability modules
- Performance overhead < 5% in benchmarks
- Clear debugging documentation

## Notes

- These phases were added after the initial 6-phase plan to properly address the complexity of these modules
- Both modules remain in the codebase and functional; only their tests are temporarily disabled
- The modular approach allows the core test infrastructure to stabilize before tackling these specialized areas
