# Coda Wiki Staging Documentation

This directory contains documentation **staged** for the project wiki. These documents are drafts and working copies that can be reviewed before being added to the actual wiki module. They provide in-depth information about features, design decisions, and usage guides.

**Note: This is NOT the wiki module itself, but a staging area for documentation that may be added to the wiki.**

## Current Staged Documents

*No documents currently staged - Tree-Sitter Intelligence documentation has been moved to the wiki.*

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Place files in this `docs/wiki-staging/` directory
2. Use descriptive filenames with hyphens (e.g., `feature-name-design.md`)
3. Update this README.md with links to new documents
4. Include:
   - Overview/purpose
   - Technical details
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Publishing to Wiki

These documents are designed to be copied to the project wiki:

1. Review and update content as needed
2. Copy markdown files to wiki
3. Update internal links to match wiki structure
4. Add navigation and categories as appropriate
5. Remove documents from staging after publishing
