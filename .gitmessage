# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# <body>
#
# <footer>
#
# Type should be one of the following:
# - feat: A new feature
# - fix: A bug fix
# - docs: Documentation only changes
# - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# - perf: A code change that improves performance
# - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
#
# Scope is optional and can be anything specifying the place of the commit change.
# For example: cli, providers, oci, tests, etc.
#
# Subject should use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# No dot (.) at the end.
#
# Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast with previous behavior.
#
# Footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place
# to reference GitHub issues that this commit closes.
#
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two
# newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
